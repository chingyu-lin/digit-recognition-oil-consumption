# Optimizer Digit Recognition Project

It project is part of the course Eleven consulting supercase - MSc Data Science for Business - HEC Paris and Ecole Polytechnique

# Team members and contribution

Ching-yu Lin / Project management, Data curation/labelling, Model architecture

Fernado Perez / End-to-end model training and fine-tuning

Jorgen Lund / Data augmentation and generation and End-to-end model training

Jiahao Wand / Digit cropping for both analog and digital digits

Akshay Sundar / Digit cropping for digital digits, digit recognition model training

# Duration

This project was conducted between 2019-Sept-18 to 2019-Sept-24.

# Final Result

We tried two different digit recognition pipelines:

1. Cropping method
2. End-to-end solution

with various data augmentation/ creation techniques.

We acheived 64.99% accuracy on digital digit testset and 59.45% on analog testset.

Our team won the first place in the technical aspect.
